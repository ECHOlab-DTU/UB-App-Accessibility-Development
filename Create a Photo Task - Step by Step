Creating a Phototask for Research Projects Using the UB App
---
In this guide, we will take you through each step to create a phototask for your research projects using the UB app.

The UB app offers two main interfaces:

User-facing Interface: Where participants can engage with tasks and generate ethnographic material.
Researcher Dashboard: Where researchers can customize settings according to the specific needs of their research.


Pre-Phototask Considerations
----
Before starting a phototask, consider the following:

Research Objectives: Define the goals and outcomes you want to achieve with this phototask.
Participant Guidelines: Clarify any instructions, themes, or criteria for participants to follow when taking photos.
Data Privacy and Consent: Ensure participants are informed about data usage, privacy policies, and have given appropriate consent.
Once you have these points in place, youâ€™re ready to create the phototask.
